## Background

This is a project I am doing for a local machine shop. They have a plasma table they use to cut a fairly high volume of standard parts. They need a way to quickly adjust the dimensions and quantity of the part in a DXF file without spending a lot of time in AutoCAD. This application will provide a handy catalogue of frequently used parts, a UI to easily input the needed dimensions and quantities, and return a DXF file ready to use.
